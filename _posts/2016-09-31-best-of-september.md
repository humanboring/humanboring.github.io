title: Best of September üçÅ
---


September has been a busy month for me, first with a visit to Croatia, and towards the end of the month starting a Masters course. Being back in full time education, I will probably not have a huge amount of time to write/tweet, but I will try to share a photo every day still on my [Instagram](http://Instagram.com/humanboring)

This photo was taken in Richmond at the tail-end of the summer. The river is one of the most relaxing places to be, especially when the sun is shining.

## Number 4

This was one of the many photos I took in Croatia, looking over the city of Dubrovnik from the panoramic viewpoint at the top of a nearby mountain. Dubrovnik was one of the most interesting places I visited, aided in part by the fact it is the setting for King‚Äôs Landing in Game of Thrones.

## Number 3

This is one of the first photos taken with my new iPhone 7\. I‚Äôm still experimenting with various features (especially the new [portrait mode](https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/hands-on-with-the-iphone-7-plus-crazy-new-portrait-mode/)), but my early impressions are very positive.

Another photo from Croatia, this time taken from the city walls of Dubrovnik‚Äôs Old Town. The Adriatic sea is amazingly blue, and since it‚Äôs so salty I was actually able to float, something I can never do in a swimming pool.

Another photo taken on my iPhone 7 plus. The level of detail, even in these lower-quality Instagram posts, is pretty great. The standout difference, however, definitely has to be the wider colour gamut. These photos really look amazing on the iPhone screen (or I‚Äôm sure the smaller iPad pro or a 5K iMac).
