title: "FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened (2019)"
---

This film review is my first non-fiction film of 2019, adding a documentary to my list. The short version of my review - it's great. Definitely worth a watch if you already have Netflix. I don't have Hulu (it's not available in the UK) so haven't watched their [similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyre_Fraud) documentary released a week beforehand.

I don't want to go too much into what happens in the documentary, in part because most people know the basic story of the Fyre festival disaster. What I will say is the level of fraud and scam went much farther than I had previously realised, with the whole festival seeming much more like a con than a mistake. What was particularly shocking is the cockiness and arrogance of Billy McFarland. The fact he was still trying to plot new scams while already under investigation was shocking.

Give this film a watch. ★★★★☆
