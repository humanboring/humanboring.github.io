title: Scored - Apple September 2018 predictions
---

Apple had their event on 12th September, and I'm finally getting round to grading my predictions.

## iPhones
- *iPhone X s (5.8”) and X s plus (6.5”) with a new gold colour.* Correct mostly, except the larger XS is called 'Max'.
- *iPhone 9 (6.1” with an X-like design, aluminium frame, a range of colours)* Correct, apart from the name (iPhone XR).
- *iPhone 8 and 8 plus.* Correct/
- *New replacement for the 7 (possibly using the SE name).* Wrong.

Total score: 3/4.

## Apple Watch
- *New designs with larger screens but similar x and y dimensions of previous models. Old bands still work. No new colours.* Correct.
- *More complications available only on the newer models.* Correct.
- *Series 3 becomes cheaper, 4g option exclusive to Series 4.* Correct.

Total score: 3/3

## Others
My prediction for other devices:
- *Updated Apple TV with faster processor.* Nope.
- *A release date for AirPower* Wrong. In fact, it may even be [cancelled](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/09/12/airpower-scrubbed).
- *A release date for AirPods wireless charging case.* Wrong.
- *No new iPads at this event.* Yep.
- *No new Macs at this event.* Correct.
- *An update on iOS 12 and Mojave (announcing release date, mentioning removal of Group FaceTime).* Not really.
- *Wildcard - Dark Mode exclusive to new iPhones and iPhone X.* No dark mode on iOS this year, so we'll have to wait for iOS 13.

Score: 2/7.

## Roundup
Overall score: 8/14. 

This year my overall result is 57%, which isn't the best grade. This is mainly due to having a large number of wildcard picks, with most of them incorrect. I'll try again when Apple has their next event, most likely next month.
