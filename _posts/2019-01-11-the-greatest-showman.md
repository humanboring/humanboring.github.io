title: The Greatest Showman (2017)
---

Is *The Greatest Showman* the best film I've ever watched? Unsurprisingly, the answer is [no](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-greatest-showman). It's cheesy and crowd-pleasing, but at the same time I had fun watching it. The songs were catchy and I can't fault any of the performances, even if the weren't Oscar-winning. It's a perfect popcorn film. Hugh Jackman seems to be moving back to his theatre / musical roots now he's finished playing Wolverine, and after watching both this and *Les Miserables* (and seeing the box-office takings of both) I can totally understand why. 

★★★☆☆
