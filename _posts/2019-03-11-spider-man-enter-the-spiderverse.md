title: "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)"
---

This film was without a doubt my favourite super-hero film of 2018. Firstly the animation is spectacular - if you haven't already go an watch the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg52up16eq0) and see for yourself how spectacular this film is. The only recent film with a style rivalling Spider-Verse was [Blade-Runner: 2049](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/) (my favourite film of 2017).

The film follows Miles Morales, a young black and latino teen living in Brooklyn who gets bitten by a radioactive spider, granting him all the powers of Spider-Man. He stubles across a supercollider that is threatening Brooklyn with distruction while also bringing other Spider-people into Miles's universe. The casting of Jake Johnson as Peter Parker helps bring what is probably my favourite big-screen version of Parker to life. Johnson's Spider-Man is an older, well-established hero, but has become slightly jaded. 

Spider-Verse is one of the best superhero films in years, reminding me of the early Sam Rami films in their optimism and presentation Spider-Man of a true hero for people to look up to.
