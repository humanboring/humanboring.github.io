title: Apple event scorecard autumn 2017
---

I know this is a little late, but here's a quick rundown of how I did in my [predictions in September](https://www.humanboring.net/2017/09/04/iPhones-in-2017.html).

## 1. There will be no 7s ✅
I got that right (mostly). The new "normal" iPhones were in fact called the 8 and 8 plus. However, I was wrong about the name of the new, top of the line model. This is infact the iPhone X [^1]

## 2. The Edition will be a 'taste from the future' ❌
We will have to see about whether the X line continues onto next year, but there was no real justification for this newest, top of the line model above the new design and features.

## 3. The Edition will be very expensive ✅
The price I predicted was pretty much dead on.

### Total score: 2/3
Not bad for a first attempt, though I'll make a slightly more extensive list of predictions in future.

[^1] Which is pronounced "10" for some strange reason. Nobody will call it that, and they will to have to call the 2019 iPhones something entirely different now.
