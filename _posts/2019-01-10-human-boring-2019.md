title: Human Boring in 2019
---

2018 was a quiet year for me online. I started a PHD program at the University of Manchester, which took up a lot of my time. Additionally, my [photo every day](https://www.instagram.com/humanboring/) kinda burned out as the year went on. Taking a photo, editing it, and posting it every day was a bit much for me to keep up. Though I mostly managed, there were several missed days. 

My project for 2019 will be a little different and hopefully a bit easier: I plan to watch a new film every week for the whole year. One important clarification is that by 'new' I mean a film that I haven't already watched, not one that's been newly released. The second half of this is that I'll be writing a brief review / my thoughts on the film I watched here. This should mean weekly posts, though some will be delayed (As you might notice, there was no post for the first week of 2019).

I'll be posting my first review later this week, and hopefully my second towards the end of the week or at the start of next.
