Since I've reached the end of the first month of my blog, I've decided to do another post today, with a countdown of my favourite photos of this month. Onwards to month two!

5. [*Alloy*](http://www.humanboring.net/blog/alloy)

I love the colour and texture in this photo. It's one of the more simple pictures I've taken this year, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

4. [*Chicken*](http://www.humanboring.net/blog/chicken)

One of the three pictures of animals I have posted so far this year, the photo of the chicken is the one I'm most pleased with. The sharply focused bird contrasted with the background worked particularly well in this photo.

3. [*5/366*](http://www.humanboring.net/blog/day_five)

This photo is what I would call a macro shot, though that might not be the correct term. [^photo] The sunset in the background added some colour to the shot, and I love the texture on this fallen branch. It's a shame that I didn't think of a better title for this post.

2. [*Glockenspiel*](http://www.humanboring.net/blog/glockenspiel)

My second favourite photo of the month, I love the pattern of shadow and light cast on the wall by the trees outside. The bright colours of the children's instrument stand out against the starkness of the rest of the photograph.

1. [*Clifton*](http://www.humanboring.net/blog/clifton)

This is my favourite photo from this month. From the darkness of the night, the lights on the Clifton Suspension bridge provide an island of illumination. The whole Clifton area is particularly beautiful, especially at night, and the views from the bridge are spectacular.
