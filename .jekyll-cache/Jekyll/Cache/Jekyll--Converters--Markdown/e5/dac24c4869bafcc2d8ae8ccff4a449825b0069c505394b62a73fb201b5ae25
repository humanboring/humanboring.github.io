I"†<p>Pixar have made some of my favourite films, from their first feature, the amazing Toy Story, to their incredible take on the superhero genre (if youâ€™ll pardon my pun). Incredibles 2 takes place immediately after the ending of the first film, even though the release was 14 years later.</p>

<p>We follow the struggles of the Parr family in a world where â€˜supersâ€™ are illegal. Elasigirl, or Hellen Parr (the mother) is recruited to act as an example of what a super can be by Rick Dicker and his very <a href="https://www.autostraddle.com/for-a-movie-thats-not-gay-incredibles-2-sure-is-gay-425276/">gay</a> sister Evelyn.</p>

<p>The animation looked great, as always in Pixar films, and the voice performances were strong. While not my favourite superhero film of 2018 (that would be Black Panther), itâ€™s another strong Pixar film and definitely worth a watch.</p>
