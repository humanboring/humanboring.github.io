I"W<p>I bought the new nylon strap for the Apple Watch when it was announced, partly because I <a href="/2016/03/11/the-apple-watch-nearly-one-year-in.html">love my watch still</a>, and partly because it was pretty cheap for a watch band at £39. I’ve been wearing it since it arrived, just over a week ago, so here are my thoughts so far.</p>
