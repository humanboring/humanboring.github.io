I"l<p>This review is pretty late, as my real life responsibilities got in the way a bit. I watched Split as film 2 of 52 this year, and was fairly pleased. The cinematography was great, especially for a horror film. I enjoyed the setting also, with most of the film taking place in an underground complex (the location of which is revealed right at the end so I wonâ€™t spoil it). The actors all do a good job in this film, and in particular the two leads (James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy, the latter the star of the excellent 2015 film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4263482/">WITCH</a>) did an excellent job.</p>
