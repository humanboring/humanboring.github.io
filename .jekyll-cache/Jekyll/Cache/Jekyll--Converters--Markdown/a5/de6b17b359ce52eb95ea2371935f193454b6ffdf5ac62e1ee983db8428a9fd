I"‘<p>2018 was a quiet year for me online. I started a PHD program at the University of Manchester, which took up a lot of my time. Additionally, my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/humanboring/">photo every day</a> kinda burned out as the year went on. Taking a photo, editing it, and posting it every day was a bit much for me to keep up. Though I mostly managed, there were several missed days.</p>
