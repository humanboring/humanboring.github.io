I"ˆ<p>In this short post I‚Äôll share my predictions on what Apple will announce in their upcoming September event. I‚Äôll follow-up with another post afterwards grading my own predictions, and seeing if I beat my previous score (2 correct predictions).</p>

<p>iPhones
Based on reading various rumours, it seems like a number of new iPhones will be announced next week: A follow up to the iPhone X (maybe called the X s), a larger version of the X, and a 6.1‚Äù cheaper iPhone with a similar design to the X. There are also some hints that there might be a replacement to the 7 of some kind. My predictions for the new line-up are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>iPhone X s (5.8‚Äù) and X s plus (6.5‚Äù) with a new gold colour.</li>
  <li>iPhone 9 (6.1‚Äù with an X-like design, aluminium frame, a range of colours)</li>
  <li>iPhone 8 and 8 plus.</li>
  <li>New replacement for the 7 (possibly using the SE name).</li>
</ul>

<p>Apple Watch
The Apple Watch series 4 is expected to be announced a this event. Thanks to a leak published by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/08/30/exclusive-apple-watch-series-4/">9to5Mac</a> we know they will feature a new design, with the screen taking up more of the face, a tweaked Digital Crown and side button, and a thinner profile. My predictions for the watch are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>New designs with larger screens but similar x and y dimensions of previous models. Old bands still work. No new colours.</li>
  <li>More complications available only on the newer models.</li>
  <li>Series 3 becomes cheaper, 4g option exclusive to Series 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>Others
My prediction for other devices:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Updated Apple TV with faster processor.</li>
  <li>A release date for AirPower</li>
  <li>A release date for AirPods wireless charging case.</li>
  <li>No new iPads at this event.</li>
  <li>No new Macs at this event.</li>
  <li>An update on iOS 12 and Mojave (announcing release date, mentioning removal of Group FaceTime).</li>
  <li>Wildcard - Dark Mode exclusive to new iPhones and iPhone X.</li>
</ul>
