I""<p>Apple had their event on 12th September, and I’m finally getting round to grading my predictions.</p>

<h2 id="iphones">iPhones</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>iPhone X s (5.8”) and X s plus (6.5”) with a new gold colour.</em> Correct mostly, except the larger XS is called ‘Max’.</li>
  <li><em>iPhone 9 (6.1” with an X-like design, aluminium frame, a range of colours)</em> Correct, apart from the name (iPhone XR).</li>
  <li><em>iPhone 8 and 8 plus.</em> Correct/</li>
  <li><em>New replacement for the 7 (possibly using the SE name).</em> Wrong.</li>
</ul>

<p>Total score: 3/4.</p>

<h2 id="apple-watch">Apple Watch</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>New designs with larger screens but similar x and y dimensions of previous models. Old bands still work. No new colours.</em> Correct.</li>
  <li><em>More complications available only on the newer models.</em> Correct.</li>
  <li><em>Series 3 becomes cheaper, 4g option exclusive to Series 4.</em> Correct.</li>
</ul>

<p>Total score: 3/3</p>

<h2 id="others">Others</h2>
<p>My prediction for other devices:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Updated Apple TV with faster processor.</em> Nope.</li>
  <li><em>A release date for AirPower</em> Wrong. In fact, it may even be <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/09/12/airpower-scrubbed">cancelled</a>.</li>
  <li><em>A release date for AirPods wireless charging case.</em> Wrong.</li>
  <li><em>No new iPads at this event.</em> Yep.</li>
  <li><em>No new Macs at this event.</em> Correct.</li>
  <li><em>An update on iOS 12 and Mojave (announcing release date, mentioning removal of Group FaceTime).</em> Not really.</li>
  <li><em>Wildcard - Dark Mode exclusive to new iPhones and iPhone X.</em> No dark mode on iOS this year, so we’ll have to wait for iOS 13.</li>
</ul>

<p>Score: 2/7.</p>

<h2 id="roundup">Roundup</h2>
<p>Overall score: 8/14.</p>

<p>This year my overall result is 57%, which isn’t the best grade. This is mainly due to having a large number of wildcard picks, with most of them incorrect. I’ll try again when Apple has their next event, most likely next month.</p>
