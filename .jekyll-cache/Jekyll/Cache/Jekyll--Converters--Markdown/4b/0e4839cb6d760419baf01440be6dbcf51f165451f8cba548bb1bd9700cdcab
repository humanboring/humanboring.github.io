I"±<p>This film was without a doubt my favourite super-hero film of 2018. Firstly the animation is spectacular - if you havenâ€™t already go an watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg52up16eq0">trailer</a> and see for yourself how spectacular this film is. The only recent film with a style rivalling Spider-Verse was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856101/">Blade-Runner: 2049</a> (my favourite film of 2017).</p>
