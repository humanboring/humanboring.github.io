I"<p>David Pogue (relatively) recently made a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/a-humble-proposition-how-to-fix-the-apple-watch-129185196924.html">post</a> on how to fix the Apple Watch. Now, I’ll fully agree that the Apple Watch is far from a perfect product but theres a few things in the article I take issue with.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s the central problem: Apple went overboard with input mechanisms. How many ways are there to navigate using a phone’s touchscreen? Four: tap, swipe, tap-and-hold, or pinch. 
But on the Apple Watch, there are seven navigation tools: Turn the crown (the knob on the side). Click the crown inward. Tap the side button. Hold in the side button. Tap the screen. Hard-press the screen. Swipe across the screen.</p>
