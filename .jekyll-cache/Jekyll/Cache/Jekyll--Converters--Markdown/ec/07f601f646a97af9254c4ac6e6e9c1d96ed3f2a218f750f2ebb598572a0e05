I":<p>All of the rumours so far have suggested that we’re going to see <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-30/how-apple-plans-to-change-the-way-you-use-the-next-iphone">three iPhones</a> announced at the event <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2017/">next week</a>: two that look somewhat similar to the 7 and 7 plus, as well as another futuristic model. I’ll get a couple of predictions out here so I can say I told you so or face the shame of being wrong online. I’ll be watching the event, and follow up with my score.</p>
