I"ž<p>This film review is my first non-fiction film of 2019, adding a documentary to my list. The short version of my review - itâ€™s great. Definitely worth a watch if you already have Netflix. I donâ€™t have Hulu (itâ€™s not available in the UK) so havenâ€™t watched their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyre_Fraud">similar</a> documentary released a week beforehand.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t want to go too much into what happens in the documentary, in part because most people know the basic story of the Fyre festival disaster. What I will say is the level of fraud and scam went much farther than I had previously realised, with the whole festival seeming much more like a con than a mistake. What was particularly shocking is the cockiness and arrogance of Billy McFarland. The fact he was still trying to plot new scams while already under investigation was shocking.</p>

<p>Give this film a watch. â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†</p>
