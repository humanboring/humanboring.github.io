I"t<p>Is <em>The Greatest Showman</em> the best film I’ve ever watched? Unsurprisingly, the answer is <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-greatest-showman">no</a>. It’s cheesy and crowd-pleasing, but at the same time I had fun watching it. The songs were catchy and I can’t fault any of the performances, even if the weren’t Oscar-winning. It’s a perfect popcorn film. Hugh Jackman seems to be moving back to his theatre / musical roots now he’s finished playing Wolverine, and after watching both this and <em>Les Miserables</em> (and seeing the box-office takings of both) I can totally understand why.</p>
