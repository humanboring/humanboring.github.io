I"<p>‘The lighthouse’ (2019) is the latest film by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3211470/">Robert Eggers</a>, who previously directed <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4263482/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_3">The Witch</a>, one of my favourite films of the last few years. In ‘The Lighthouse’ we follow Ephraim Winslow (Robert Patterson), a trainee wickie for a lighthouse on an island off the New England coast run by Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe). With the isolated setting, paranoia soon starts to creep in.</p>
