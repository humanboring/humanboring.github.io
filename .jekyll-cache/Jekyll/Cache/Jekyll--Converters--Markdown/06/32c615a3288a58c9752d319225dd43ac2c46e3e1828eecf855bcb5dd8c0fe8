I"Œ<p>Is <em>The Greatest Showman</em> the best film Iâ€™ve ever watched? Unsurprisingly, the answer is <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-greatest-showman">no</a>. Itâ€™s cheesy and crowd-pleasing, but at the same time I had fun watching it. The songs were catchy and I canâ€™t fault any of the performances, even if the werenâ€™t Oscar-winning. Itâ€™s a perfect popcorn film. Hugh Jackman seems to be moving back to his theatre / musical roots now heâ€™s finished playing Wolverine, and after watching both this and <em>Les Miserables</em> (and seeing the box-office takings of both) I can totally understand why.</p>
