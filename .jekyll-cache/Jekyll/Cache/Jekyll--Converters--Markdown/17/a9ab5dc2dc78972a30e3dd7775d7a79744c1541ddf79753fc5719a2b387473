I"'<p>‘Us’ is the second film by director Jordan Peele, following on from the hugely successful ‘Get Out’. This horror film focusses on a family on holiday in Santa Cruz. When the mother (Adelaide, played by Lupita Nyong’o) was a child, she had visited this beach. After wondering off on her own, she entered a hall of mirrors and met a girl who looked exactly like her, an even that scarred her. While the family is staying in the same area in the present day, Adelaide and her family are terrorised by people that look exactly like them.</p>
