I"{<p>This film review is my first non-fiction film of 2019, adding a documentary to my list. The short version of my review - it’s great. Definitely worth a watch if you already have Netflix. I don’t have Hulu (it’s not available in the UK) so haven’t watched their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyre_Fraud">similar</a> documentary released a week beforehand.</p>
