I"{<p>I’ve been using my Apple Watch since launch, nearly one year ago now, so I thought I’d write about how I’m using it now the ‘new gadget’ excitement has worn off. For those who want the quick summary: I don’t use everything on the watch, but still use it every day, and don’t regret buying it at all.
