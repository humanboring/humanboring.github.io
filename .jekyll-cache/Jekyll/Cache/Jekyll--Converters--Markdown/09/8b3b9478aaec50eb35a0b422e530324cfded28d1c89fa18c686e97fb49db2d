I"­<p>This was not a good film. Unfriended: Dark Web is the sequel to the 2014 film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3713166/">Unfriended</a>. It shares the horror â€˜gimmickâ€™ of the whole film taking place inside a computer screen. The characters in our film are on a Skype call together, with our protagonist Mathias having stollen a laptop from a lost-and-found box. However, it turns out this computer belonged to a hacker, meaning our protagonists have become tangled in a larger game. Unlike the first film, there is almost no supernatural element to â€˜Dark Webâ€™, with the exception of the almost god-like hacking ability of the shadowy group terrorising the friends.</p>
