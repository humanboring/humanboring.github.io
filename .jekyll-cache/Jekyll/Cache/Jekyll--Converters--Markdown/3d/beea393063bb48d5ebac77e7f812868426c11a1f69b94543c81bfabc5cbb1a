I"å<p>â€˜The lighthouseâ€™ (2019) is the latest film by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3211470/">Robert Eggers</a>, who previously directed <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4263482/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_3">The Witch</a>, one of my favourite films of the last few years. In â€˜The Lighthouseâ€™ we follow Ephraim Winslow (Robert Patterson), a trainee wickie for a lighthouse on an island off the New England coast run by Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe). With the isolated setting, paranoia soon starts to creep in.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t want to get too much more into the plot, but itâ€™s safe to say that this is one of my favourite films of the last decade. The black and white film, as well as the unusual 1.19:1 aspect ratio helps make this feel like a film from the 19th-centure, adding to the atmosphere. Both Patterson and Dafoe put in excellent perfomances, which is important when there arenâ€™t realy any supporting cast. This film  has me excited to see Pattersonâ€™s take as the Batman, having proved his range and firmly established himself as a serious actor outside of the Twilight franchise.</p>

<p>If you like psychological horror like â€˜The Witchâ€™ or â€˜The Shiningâ€™, this is definitely a film to check out.</p>
