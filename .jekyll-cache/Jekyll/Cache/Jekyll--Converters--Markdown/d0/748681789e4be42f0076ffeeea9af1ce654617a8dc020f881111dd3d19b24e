I"¸<p>September has been a busy month for me, first with a visit to Croatia, and towards the end of the month starting a Masters course. Being back in full time education, I will probably not have a huge amount of time to write/tweet, but I will try to share a photo every day still on my <a href="http://Instagram.com/humanboring">Instagram</a></p>

<p>This photo was taken in Richmond at the tail-end of the summer. The river is one of the most relaxing places to be, especially when the sun is shining.</p>

<h2 id="number-4">Number 4</h2>

<p>This was one of the many photos I took in Croatia, looking over the city of Dubrovnik from the panoramic viewpoint at the top of a nearby mountain. Dubrovnik was one of the most interesting places I visited, aided in part by the fact it is the setting for Kingâ€™s Landing in Game of Thrones.</p>

<h2 id="number-3">Number 3</h2>

<p>This is one of the first photos taken with my new iPhone 7. Iâ€™m still experimenting with various features (especially the new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/hands-on-with-the-iphone-7-plus-crazy-new-portrait-mode/">portrait mode</a>), but my early impressions are very positive.</p>

<p>Another photo from Croatia, this time taken from the city walls of Dubrovnikâ€™s Old Town. The Adriatic sea is amazingly blue, and since itâ€™s so salty I was actually able to float, something I can never do in a swimming pool.</p>

<h2 id="number-1">Number 1</h2>

<p>Another photo taken on my iPhone 7 plus. The level of detail, even in these lower-quality Instagram posts, is pretty great. The standout difference, however, definitely has to be the wider colour gamut. These photos really look amazing on the iPhone screen (or Iâ€™m sure the smaller iPad pro or a 5K iMac).</p>
