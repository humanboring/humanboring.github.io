I"'<p>Pixar have made some of my favourite films, from their first feature, the amazing Toy Story, to their incredible take on the superhero genre (if youâ€™ll pardon my pun). Incredibles 2 takes place immediately after the ending of the first film, even though the release was 14 years later.</p>
