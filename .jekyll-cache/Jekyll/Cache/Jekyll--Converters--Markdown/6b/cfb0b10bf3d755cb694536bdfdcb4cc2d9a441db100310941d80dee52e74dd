I"‰<p>I know this is a little late, but here‚Äôs a quick rundown of how I did in my <a href="https://www.humanboring.net/2017/09/04/iPhones-in-2017.html">predictions in September</a>.</p>

<h2 id="1-there-will-be-no-7s-">1. There will be no 7s ‚úÖ</h2>
<p>I got that right (mostly). The new ‚Äúnormal‚Äù iPhones were in fact called the 8 and 8 plus. However, I was wrong about the name of the new, top of the line model. This is infact the iPhone X [^1]</p>

<h2 id="2-the-edition-will-be-a-taste-from-the-future-">2. The Edition will be a ‚Äòtaste from the future‚Äô ‚ùå</h2>
<p>We will have to see about whether the X line continues onto next year, but there was no real justification for this newest, top of the line model above the new design and features.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-edition-will-be-very-expensive-">3. The Edition will be very expensive ‚úÖ</h2>
<p>The price I predicted was pretty much dead on.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="total-score-23">Total score: 2/3</h3>
<p>Not bad for a first attempt, though I‚Äôll make a slightly more extensive list of predictions in future.</p>

<p>[^1] Which is pronounced ‚Äú10‚Äù for some strange reason. Nobody will call it that, and they will to have to call the 2019 iPhones something entirely different now.</p>
